# ISS-Space-Station

This is a Python program ran on Trinket and in this project you will use a web service to find out the current location of the International Space Station (ISS) and plot its location on a map. 

For this project you need: 
- Trinket, an online editor
- Notify webservices (http://api.open-notify.org)

In this project I used json and turtle to show the ISS on a world map. It shows real time data and can show when the 
ISS will be over your location, by inputting your longitude and latitude (it is currently set to London.) To find the longitude and latitude I used www.latlong.net/.

In the screenshot below you can see that the yellow is when it would pass over London and the where the space craft is currently.
